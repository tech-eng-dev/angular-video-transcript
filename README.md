# Videojs Transcript Angular application

## Description

This application is to show a visual transcript to the right side of the video so the user can see the list of subtitles in one place, search the transcripts for a specific area, and then jump to that section of the video directly by clicking on the correct transcript.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
